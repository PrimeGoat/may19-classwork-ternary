//1.
// const person = [{ name: "Jill" }, { name: "" }, { name: "Bob" }];
//create a function 'greeting' that maps through the array.
// Use a ternary.
// If there is a name it should say 'Hello <name>' otherwise it should say,
// 'Hello Stranger'.
//2.
///Create a function that uses ternary to decide whether the person can drive
// If they are below 15 then log 'cannot drive', if they are 15 then log 'can drive with a parent', if they are 16 or above then 'yes they can drive'
//3.
// create a variable speedMessage that has a value resulting from a ternary
// if the speed equals 70 it should say '70 is the perfect speed'
// if the speed is greater than or equal to 90 it should say 'Are you trying to get us killed'
// if the speed is less than 50 it should have the value 'Faster please'
// if speed is less than 10 it should say you should not drive
// there should be a default value that says (if speed is 75 for example), '75 is a decent enough speed'
// ---
//4. 
// map through an array and if the value is greater than 50 it goes in the arr1
//if the array is less than 50 it goes in arr2
// if the value is a string arr3
//floating point numbers should only have 2 decimal places with the exact numbers not rounded
//use ternary
// use an array method BUT do not return a data structure when you iterate through your items.
// OUTPUT:
//[ 445, 4555 ][ 22, 33.99, 1, 44.98 ] [ 'peaches', 'apple' ]
